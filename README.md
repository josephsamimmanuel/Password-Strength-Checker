**Title: Password Strength Checker**

**Objective:**
Create a web page that allows users to check the strength of their passwords. The page should visually indicate the strength of the password by altering the background image â€“ a blurred image for weak passwords and a clear image for strong passwords.

**Technologies Used:**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

**Features:**

1. **Password Input Field:**
   - Include an input field for users to enter their password.

2. **Password Strength Indicator:**
   - Use JavaScript to analyze the entered password and determine its strength.
   - Implement a basic password strength algorithm to classify passwords as weak, moderate, or strong based on criteria like length, presence of uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

3. **Background Image Effect:**
   - Set a background image for the web page.
   - When the user enters a password, dynamically adjust the background image based on the strength of the password.
   - For weak passwords, apply a blur effect to the background image.
   - For moderate or strong passwords, keep the background image clear.

4. **Visual Feedback:**
   - Provide visual feedback to the user about the strength of their password.
   - Display a message or color-coded indicator (e.g., red for weak, yellow for moderate, green for strong) to signify the strength level.

5. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure that the web page is responsive and works well on various screen sizes and devices.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **HTML Structure:**
   - Create the basic HTML structure with input fields, labels, and placeholders.

2. **CSS Styling:**
   - Style the page using CSS to make it visually appealing.
   - Apply appropriate styles for the password strength indicators and feedback messages.

3. **JavaScript Logic:**
   - Write JavaScript functions to analyze the password strength.
   - Use DOM manipulation to dynamically update the background image and display strength indicators.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test the web page with various passwords to ensure the strength indicator and background image adjustments work correctly.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Provide clear comments in your code for better understanding.
   - Write a brief documentation explaining how the password strength is determined and how the background image effect is achieved.

6. **Optimization:**
   - Optimize the code and ensure that it follows best practices.

**Conclusion:**
This project aims to create a user-friendly web page that not only checks the strength of passwords but also provides a visually intuitive way for users to understand the strength of their chosen passwords.
